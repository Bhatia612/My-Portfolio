# Why Building Small Projects Beats Endless Tutorials

I used to think that **watching tutorials was enough** to become a developer. I’d binge course after course, notebook full of “best practices,” and… nothing really working in the real world.

Then I started **actually building small projects**, and everything clicked.

## The Problem with Tutorials

- You passively consume knowledge.  
- Projects in tutorials are usually too guided — you never hit the real “problem-solving” moments.  
- It’s easy to feel busy but not productive.

## The Power of Small Projects

Even tiny projects teach things tutorials can’t:

1. **Debugging teaches resilience** – nothing in tutorials prepares you for a component breaking for no obvious reason.  
2. **Decision-making** – choosing your own folder structure, tools, and approaches.  
3. **Ownership** – seeing a project fully built gives motivation and confidence.

For example, building a **simple blog app** forced me to learn React state, file structure, and routing in a way watching videos never did.

## My Takeaway

- **Start small**: a single component, a small webpage, a utility app.  
- **Iterate**: improve it over time rather than waiting for perfection.  
- **Document lessons**: write what you learned, even if it’s tiny — it compounds.

Building teaches far more than consuming. Tutorials are great, but **action is the shortcut to mastery**.
