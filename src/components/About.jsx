                <li>» Self-made Full-Stack Web Developer and Design Engineer, grinding consistently for the past few years — fueled by curiosity (and a healthy amount of coffee).</li>
                <li>» Skilled in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and modern front-end & back-end technologies.</li>
                <li>» Passionate about building user-centric, scalable, performance-driven web applications that actually work in production — not just in demos.</li>
                <li>» Strong problem-solving mindset, with attention to clean, maintainable code (yes, I refactor my own code).</li>
                <li>» Constantly exploring new tools and technologies, because staying comfortable is not part of the plan.</li>
                <li>» Committed to continuous improvement — shipping better code today than I did yesterday.</li>
            </ul>
