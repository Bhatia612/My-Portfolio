                <li> Full-Stack Web Developer with 2+ years invested in understanding how things actually work - not just how to copy-paste them.</li>
                <li> Strong foundation in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and modern front-end/back-end architecture.</li>
                <li> Currently building and contributing to real-world products, turning theory into software that solves practical problems.</li>
                <li> Focused on creating scalable, user-centered applications that behave properly outside of localhost.</li>
                <li> Strong problem-solving mindset with respect for clean, maintainable code (future me should not suffer).</li>
                <li> Curious by default - always exploring better tools, better patterns, and better ways to architect solutions.</li>
                <li> Committed to continuous improvement - fewer bugs, fewer hacks, and fewer “it works on my machine” moments.</li>
